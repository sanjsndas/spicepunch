            <p>Welcome to SpicePunch! We are passionate about bold flavors and spicy experiences. However, please be aware that the recipes and spice-level guides provided on this platform are for informational and entertainment purposes only. The heat levels indicated (Mild Kick, Medium Burn, Full Punch) are subjective and based on general culinary understanding and our testing.

We strongly advise users to exercise caution, especially when attempting recipes with high heat levels or using extremely potent chilies like the Carolina Reaper, Ghost Pepper, or Trinidad Moruga Scorpion. Always handle hot peppers with gloves and avoid touching your eyes or other sensitive areas. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling chilies. If you have any known allergies, sensitivities, or pre-existing medical conditions (such as digestive issues, heart conditions, or respiratory problems), consult with a healthcare professional before consuming highly spicy foods.
