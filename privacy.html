            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>Welcome to SpicePunch! We are passionate about bold flavors and spicy experiences. However, please be aware that the recipes and spice-level guides provided on this platform are for informational and entertainment purposes only. The heat levels indicated (Mild Kick, Medium Burn, Full Punch) are subjective and based on general culinary understanding and our testing. Individual tolerance to capsaicin (the compound that makes chilies hot) varies significantly. What one person perceives as a "Mild Kick" might be a "Full Punch" for another. We strongly advise users to exercise caution, especially when attempting recipes with high heat levels or using extremely potent chilies like the Carolina Reaper, Ghost Pepper, or Trinidad Moruga Scorpion. Always handle hot peppers with gloves and avoid touching your eyes or other sensitive areas. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling chilies. If you have any known allergies, sensitivities, or pre-existing medical conditions (such as digestive issues, heart conditions, or respiratory problems), consult with a healthcare professional before consuming highly spicy foods. Spicy foods can exacerbate certain conditions. Children and individuals with low spice tolerance should be particularly careful. We are not responsible for any adverse reactions, discomfort, or health issues that may arise from consuming or preparing dishes from our recipes. All recipes should be prepared in a safe and hygienic environment, adhering to standard food safety practices. Always ensure ingredients are fresh and properly handled. The content on SpicePunch is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this website. By using this website and attempting our recipes, you acknowledge and agree that you do so at your own risk. SpicePunch and its creators, owners, affiliates, and employees shall not be held liable for any damages, injuries, or losses arising from the use of the information or recipes provided herein. We aim to provide delicious and exciting culinary experiences, but your safety and well-being are paramount. Please spice responsibly!</p>
            <p>Further, while we strive for accuracy in our global spice education, the information on origins, traditional uses, and intensities is based on generally accepted culinary knowledge and research. Regional variations and specific cultural practices may exist, and our guides represent a general overview. Always cross-reference with multiple sources if you are conducting academic research or need precise historical details. The DIY spice blend suggestions are intended as starting points; feel free to adjust ratios and ingredients to suit your personal taste and desired flavor profile. Ingredient availability may vary by region, and substitutions may be necessary. Always ensure that any substitutions maintain food safety standards. We encourage adventurous cooks to experiment but within reasonable limits of safety and taste. Enjoy the journey of discovery, and may your culinary adventures be full of bold, fantastic flavors!</p>
